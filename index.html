      <p><span>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML</span> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayedin a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style sheets(CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
      <p>HTML code example: *</p>
        <code> <p> this is a paragraph element in HTML< /p> </p></code>

All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' device.</p>

        <p>AN <span>Application progroamming Interface (APIS)</span> is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. [1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to imp;ement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.Whereas a system's user interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, its API dictates how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.</p>
